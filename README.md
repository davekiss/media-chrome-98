# Windows 98 Video Player

A nostalgic Windows 98-style video player built with [Media Chrome](https://www.media-chrome.org/) and [Mux](https://mux.com/). This project combines retro aesthetics with modern web video technology for a delightfully throwback user experience.

So authentic, you'll instinctively want to defrag your hard drive.

## What's it do?

This demo recreates the classic Windows 98 experience with:

- A draggable window that leaves ghostly trails when moved
- Windows 98-style UI elements (buttons, title bar, status bar)
- Custom cursor from the Windows 98 era
- Video playback powered by Mux and Media Chrome
- Random "buffering" moments that mimic spotty internet connections from the 90s
- Selection box drawing capability
- Authentic system sounds

## What's the tech stack?

The project uses:

- [98.css](https://jdan.github.io/98.css/) for authentic Windows 98 styling
- [Media Chrome](https://www.media-chrome.org/) for customizable media player controls
- [Mux](https://mux.com/) for reliable video streaming
- HTML5 Canvas for the cursor trails and selection box effects
- HTML2Canvas for capturing window states during dragging
- Custom SVG cursors and pixel-perfect icons

## Easter Eggies

There are several hidden features and nostalgic references throughout the application. Can you find them all?
